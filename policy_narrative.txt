Unequal Beginnings: Addressing Child Mortality Trends in Sub-Saharan Africa (July, 2025)

In Sub-Saharan Africa, under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) remain a critical public health issue, with 58% of global under-5 deaths in 2023 occurring in this region (UNICEF, 2025). As of mid-2025, analysis of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria from 2018 to 2022 highlights significant disparities. Nigeria’s U5MR in 2022 was 110.8 per 1,000 live births, far exceeding Ethiopia’s 48.7 and Kenya’s 41.1, reflecting a higher burden of preventable deaths from malaria, pneumonia, and malnutrition. Ethiopia and Kenya have achieved notable declines (13.5% and 7.2% reductions, respectively, from 2018–2022), while Nigeria’s progress is slower at 8.1%, underscoring uneven regional trends (World Bank, 2023). Heatmap analysis reveals a weak positive correlation between U5MR and female education (0.167993), a moderate positive correlation with sanitation access (0.586153), and a strong positive correlation between female education and sanitation (0.768120). These findings suggest that, in this dataset, higher female education and sanitation are not strongly reducing U5MR, possibly due to confounding factors, while education strongly supports sanitation improvements.

Policy Recommendations:
1. **Investigate Education Impact**: Explore why the weak 0.167993 correlation between U5MR and female education exists, particularly in Ethiopia (11.3% of women aged 25+ completed lower secondary in 2022). Conduct studies on education quality and rural access to refine interventions, using targeted literacy programs to enhance maternal health outcomes.
2. **Reassess Sanitation Strategies**: Address the moderate 0.586153 correlation between U5MR and sanitation, which contradicts expected negative trends. In Ethiopia (9.3% coverage in 2022 vs. Kenya’s 35.9% and Nigeria’s 44.1%), improve sanitation alongside nutrition and healthcare to break the positive mortality link, possibly due to co-occurring risk factors.
3. **Address Malnutrition**: Scale up nutrition interventions, such as micronutrient supplementation and community-based management of acute malnutrition, focusing on Nigeria, where U5MR remains high at 110.8 per 1,000 live births due to malnutrition-related causes.
4. **Improve Healthcare Access**: Increase health facility deliveries through mobile clinics and trained midwives, targeting rural Nigeria and Ethiopia, to reduce intrapartum complications and align with observed mortality declines.
5. **Leverage Education-Sanitation Link**: Capitalize on the strong 0.768120 correlation between female education and sanitation by integrating education campaigns with sanitation infrastructure projects, especially in Ethiopia, to maximize health benefits.
6. **Monitor and Adapt**: Utilize the  developed dashboard, to track U5MR trends and correlation shifts, enabling data-driven policy adjustments and further research into unexpected patterns.

Addressing these disparities requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach. The heatmap’s insights challenge conventional assumptions, suggesting that while female education and sanitation are interlinked (0.768120), their direct impact on reducing U5MR (0.167993 and 0.586153) may be influenced by other factors. By addressing malnutrition, healthcare access, and underlying drivers alongside targeted research, policymakers can accelerate progress toward the SDG target of reducing U5MR to 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030, ensuring no child is left behind in Sub-Saharan Africa.
